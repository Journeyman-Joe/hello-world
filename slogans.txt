A good programmer looks both ways when crossing a one-way street.

Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability.

The difference between science and screwing around is writing stuff down.  --Adam Savage
(Not the ONLY difference... --Joe Levy)

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live.

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.
